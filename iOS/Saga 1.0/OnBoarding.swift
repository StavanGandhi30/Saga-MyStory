Journaling boosts confidence on multiple levels. It makes you more at ease with yourself as you learn more about yourself and your surroundings. If you journal on a regular basis, you will noticeably improve your ability to express yourself, and expressing yourself in any medium is essential for creativity. You become more eager to create once your confidence has been boosted a little.",
